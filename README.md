## Project description
 
## Installation
You can "install" this web page by downloading it and running it on a live server. You could use an external application such as XAMPP for this purpose. IDEs like Visual Studio Code have this feature built in.

When using XAMPP it is important to put the project in the htdocs folder. Then you can click on the Apache module. When you go to your browser and type in localhost/project name, it should open.

In case you have Visual Studio Code installed, you can open the project in there. Clicking on the 'Go Live' button in the status bar will open a live server where you should be able to see the project.
